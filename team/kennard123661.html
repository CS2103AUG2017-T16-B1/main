<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ark is a desktop delivery management application that my team and I built for our Software Engineering module in the
National University of Singapore. We built this application for delivery companies to manage their deliveries.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14kLoC.
 You may access the Ark repository <a href="https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ark was built on top of <a href=":https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4">Addressbook - Level 4</a>, an
addressbook application. A number of features were added and refactoring was done to develop the original codebase
into the parcel management application, Ark.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may access the links below for a list of more significant contributions I have made to Ark. Functional code
refers to the code that I have written to enhance the Ark application while Test code refers to the code that I have written
to automate testing for the Ark application.</p>

<p>Parcel companies manage millions of deliveries on a daily basis. As such, they have to deal with large amounts of
data and deliveries. Furthermore, adding parcels into Ark individually is time consuming. Hence, I built a
feature that allows parcel companies to import parcels from same files, and add parcels into Ark more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, parcels are usually passed from one delivery company to another (or to another shipping company). Hence, I
wanted to make it possible for delivery companies to be able to transfer their Ark save files to each other as they
transfer stewardship of parcels. This would save delivery companies time since they do not need to re-enter data that
the previous delivery company had already entered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I designed this feature to accept <code>.xml</code> only files since Ark stores its files in <code>.xml</code> format and I wanted the
 import command to be compatible with its save files so that it can import its save files.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use this command, type <code>import (FILE_NAME)</code> into the <code>CommandBox</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Import</code> mechanism allows users to import parcels from valid <code>Ark</code> storage files stored as <code>.xml</code> files into the
current instance of <code>Ark</code>. This mecahnism is facilitated by a <code>readAddressBook</code> method within`XmlAddressBookStorage` to
load the parcels stored in the <code>xml</code> file and an <code>addAllParcels</code> method defined in <code>ModelManager</code> to add the parcels in
the storage file into the current instance of <code>Ark</code>.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the <code>Import</code> mechanism modifies the state of the data in <code>Ark</code>, it has to be undoable. Thus, it inherits from
<code>UndoableCommands</code> interface rather than inheriting from the <code>Command</code> interface directly.<br></p>

The file to be imported has to be stored in the <code>./data/import</code> folder. i.e. calling <code>import ark.xml</code> will import the
file <code>./data/import/ark.xml</code>.<br>
If the user enters a file name that is not alphanumeric or a file name that is not in a <code>.xml</code> format, the parcel will
throw an Exception. This is to prevent a directory traversal attack on Ark. Read more about directory traversal

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect: Implementation of <code>ImportCommand</code></strong><br></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice): using <code>readAddressBook()</code> to implement the logic <code>ImportCommand</code></strong><br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It becomes easier to implement method rather than writing out a separate logic to import files. It
makes updates easier since enhancements to <code>readAddressBook()</code> will also enhance the import command such as
more supported save file formats.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> This implementation increases the coupling of the <code>readAddressBook()</code> and <code>ImportCommand</code> such that changes
in <code>readAddressBook()</code> is likely to cause a change in <code>ImportCommand</code>.<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Implement a parsing logic for <code>ImportCommand</code>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reduced coupling of <code>readAddressBook()</code> and <code>ImportCommand</code>. This gives the developers more freedom on
adding more file formats that can be imported.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> More tedious to implement and maintain <code>ImportCommand</code> since enhancements to the <code>readAddressBook()</code>
feature has to be manually implemented in <code>ImportCommand</code> as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Backup save files from only one location<br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> User will only stored his save files at one location, he will not store them at random locations and lose
track of them. User only has to type the name of the file and does not need to type the full file path to locate
the file. i.e. the user does not need to type <code>./data/import/Ark.xml</code>.<br></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The user has restrictions on where he can import files from.<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> User can load the files from any directory<br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Allows user to import from his own archived folders anywhere in this computer.<br></p>

<li>
<p>Firstly, open the <code>/data/</code> folder in the home directory of Ark.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Ark Application. If Ark fails to start as a result of corrupted data in your Ark save file, simply delete
the corrupted save file and restart the Ark application.</p>

<p>Finally, import the backup save file into Ark by using the <code>import</code> command by typing <code>import (back-up file name)</code> .
i.e. <code>import ark-backup.xml</code><br></p>

Presently, the <code>PostalCode</code> field still does a very relaxed validation and does not completely ensure that the postal

 into Ark and ensure that the postal code inputs are valid.

It only accepts values of <code>s</code> or <code>S</code> followed by 6 digits. The value stored in this class is used to store the postal

</li>

<p>Added Tooltip on mouseover of fields in the parcel. This was a necessary change since parts of the field will be
missing and be replaced if with ellipsis <code>&#8230;&#8203;</code> if it was too long. You can view my pull-request

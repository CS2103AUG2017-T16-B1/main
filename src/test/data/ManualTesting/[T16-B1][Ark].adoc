== Introduction
Ark is a parcel delivery management system to help delivery companies manage their parcels and their
deliveries. This test script is used help testers perform manual testing of Ark.

== Quick Start



== Commands

=== Import Command

Command format: `import (FILE_NAME)`. e.g. `import ark_save` +
Description: This command allows you to add multiple parcels from a valid Ark storage file that is stored
 in the `./data/import/` directory. e.g. `import ark_save` will import `./data/import/ark_save.xml`. +
Presently, Ark only supports `.xml` storage files in format. +

Before you use test command, copy the following sample `.xml` files into Ark: +

* [T16-B1][Ark]ark_save.xml
* [T16-B1][Ark]empty.xml
* [T16-B1][Ark]notXmlFormatAddressBook.xml

==== Manual Testing

*Description:* Regular import. +
*Input:* `import ark_save` +
*Expected output:* Ark should add the new parcels into the running instance of Ark. Duplicate parcels are ignored.
Duplicate parcels are parcels with the same details (every detail except Status and Tag is used for comparison).
Non-duplicate parcels are added. Ark should display of parcels added and parcels that are not added in the results box. +

*Description:*  Import the save file (will contain duplicate parcels now). +
*Input:* `import ark_save` +
*Expected output:* Ark should warn you that all parcels in the save file are duplicate parcels. Nothing happens. +

*Description:* Importing an empty save file +
*Input:* `import empty` +
*Expected output:* Ark should warn you that the file you want to import is empty.

*Description:* Importing an empty save file +
*Input:* `import empty` +
*Expected output:* Ark should warn you that the file you want to import is empty.

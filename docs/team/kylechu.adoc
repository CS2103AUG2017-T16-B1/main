== Project: Ark
Ark is a desktop delivery management application that my team and I had built for our Software Engineering module in the
National University of Singapore. We built this application for delivery companies to manage their deliveries.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14kLoC.
You may access the Ark repository link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main[here].

Ark was built on top of link::https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook - Level 4], an
addressbook application. A number of features were added and refactoring was done to develop the original codebase
into the parcel management application, Ark.

You may access the links below for a list of more significant contributions I have made to Ark. Functional code
refers to the code that I have written to enhance the Ark application while Test code refers to the code that I have written
to automate testing for the Ark application.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/Kowalski985.md[Functional code]][https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/Kowalski985.md[Test code]]

The following are my contributions to the project explained in detail:

=== Enhancement Added: Tab autocomplete

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Ark is an application that our users will be using on a regular basis. Therefore, a tab autocomplete feature will make
it easier for our users to use the application and to improve their productivity. This increase in productivity is
essential since Ark is meant to be used by people managing large volumes of deliveries each day.
